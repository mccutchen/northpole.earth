                <p>Merry Christmas, Kei!</p>

                <p>
                    Your moms told me that you would be in England for Christmas, so I left your biggest presents in
                    your garage because they were too big to fit on a plane ride home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you enjoy your trip, and when you get back, you can enjoy all these wonderful gifts!
                </p>

                <p>
                    My little elves told me that you did not think I sent them to watch over you. Well, guess again! As
                    you
                    can see, both of
                    them have not only been watching you all year, but they will watch out for and protect these new
                    toys
                    until you get
                    home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Remember to always be thankful for the wonderful family and friends you have, and be grateful for
                    how
                    blessed you truly
                    are!
                </p>

                <p>See you next Christmas!</p>
